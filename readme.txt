###Multiple Kronecker RLS fusion-based link propagation for drug-side effect prediction

### Overview
Drug-side effects prediction has become an essential area of research in the field of pharmacology. As the use of medications continues to rise, so does the importance of understanding and mitigating the potential risks associated with them. At present, researchers turned to data-driven methods to predict drug-side effects. The drug-side effect prediction is a link prediction problem and the related data can be described in various views. To process these kinds of data, a multi-view method, called MV Kron-RLS, is proposed. It extends the Kron-RLS by finding the consensus partitions and multiple graphs Laplacian constraints in the multi-view setting. Both of these multi-view settings contribute to a higher quality result. Extensive experiments have been conducted on drug-side effect datasets, and our empirical results provide evidence that our approach is effective and robust.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.8, Matlab 2018b.


### Note
The NTK kernel matrix needs to be calculated using kernel.py.
